### LanStellar: Decentralized Real World Asset Verification Platform
### Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision 
LanStellar is a decentralized platform that uses AI agents to verify real-world assets' ownership, history, market value, and legitimacy built on the superchain. The MVP will enable users to search for Asset details using location or GPS coordinates, generate a unique contract address for each Asset, and provide verified Asset data to help investors make informed decisions.

### 1.2 Target Audience
Real World Assets investors (local and international).
RWA developers and agents.

### Blockchain and crypto enthusiasts interested in RWA.
1.3 Key Objectives

Provide a seamless way to verify Asset ownership and history.


Generate unique contract addresses for properties using street addresses or GPS coordinates.


Offer AI-powered insights into Asset legitimacy and market value.


Build a foundation for future scalability and open-source contributions.


MVP Features


### 2.1 Core Features
Asset Search:


Users can search for Asset using:
Location.
GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).
The system generates a unique contract address for each asset.
Unique Contract Address Generation:


A hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) converts location or GPS coordinates into unique contract addresses.
These addresses are stored on the blockchain for transparency and immutability.
Asset Verification:


AI agents verify:
Ownership history (from government land registries or other sources).
Market value (using historical sales data and trends).
Legitimacy (fraud detection, duplicate titles, etc.).
User Authentication:


Users can sign in with(Account Abstraction):
Wallet address (e.g., MetaMask).
Gmail account.
Asset Dashboard:


Displays key Asset details:
Ownership history.
Market value.
Legitimacy status (verified, unverified, or flagged).
Unique contract address.
Open Source Framework:


### Basic GitHub repository setup for open-source contributions.
Documentation for developers to understand the codebase.
2.2 Non-Core Features (Post-MVP)
Advanced AI fraud detection.
Investment recommendations.
Multi-language support.
Mobile app integration.
